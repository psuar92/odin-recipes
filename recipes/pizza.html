    <p>Pizza is a great way to start the day!</p>
    <h5>Ingredients for crust:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ¾ cups all-purpose flour, or more if needed</li>
        <li>1 envelope Fleischmann's® Pizza Crust Yeast or RapidRise Yeast</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅔ cup water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Toppings:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>8 ounces sausage, cooked and crumbled</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen hash brown potatoes, thawed</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Durkee® Ground Mustard</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon Durkee® Fine Grind Black Pepper</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Instructions:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 1 cup flour, undissolved yeast and salt in a large bowl. Heat water and oil until very warm (120
            degrees to 130 degrees F). Add to flour mixture and beat for 2 minutes. Add enough remaining flour to make a
            soft dough. Knead until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. (If using RapidRise yeast, let dough rest at
            this point for 10 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Roll dough to 12-inch circle; place in greased pizza pan. OR, pat dough with floured hands, pressing gently
            to fill greased pizza pan or baking sheet. Form a rim by pinching the edge of the dough; prick surface with
            fork.</li>
        <li>Bake crust in preheated 450 degrees F oven on lowest oven rack for 8 minutes. Reduce oven to 375 degrees F.
            Remove pizza from oven.</li>
        <li>Top pizza crust with sausage, hash browns and onions. Beat eggs, ground mustard, pepper and salt together
            in a bowl. Pour over toppings. Sprinkle with cheese. Bake for 16 to 20 minutes until eggs are set and crust
            is browned.</li>
    </ol>
